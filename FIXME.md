- xenodm is not starting on desktop vm
- pretty sure the internal network is not going to work as-is since it's NAT
- installer needs a UI
- make this thing like a OpenBSD distro, linux style. Live CD, with installer, "software center" app. Make it not suck so bad as a desktop. Also make configuring as a router not suck so bad - ncurses menu
- new templates/roles for Tor bridges, relays
- make it a distro like Qubes using child VMs
- architect the network like Qubes does for VMs - PD or CP is like Dom0 and firewall, DNS, etc are just other qubes that aren't fully trusted.
- learn how to run a VM using OpenBSD's vm tool - good starter is running Alpine with Docker
- build a UI, like that one for Docker, for managing VMs
